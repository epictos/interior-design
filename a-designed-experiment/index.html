A designed experiment aims to eliminate sources of bias such as the bias that would occur from testing an intervention in subjects who are undergoing developments in their condition anyways. This best practice is the first part of a series that will show how to deal with categorical data types in a designed experiment. Thinking about what could impact the loss of moisture it is likely that the baking time and the oven temperature will affect the results.

<p>A designed experiment is an experiment where one or more factors called independent variables believed to have an effect on the experimental outcome are identified and manipulated according to a predetermined plan. For example if you believe that there is an interaction between two variables be sure to include both variables in your design. A designed experiment is a series of runs or tests in which you purposefully make changes to input variables at the same time and observe the responses. A designed experiment is a test or series of tests in which purposeful changes are made to the input variables of a process or system so that we may observe and identify the reasons for changes in the output response.
