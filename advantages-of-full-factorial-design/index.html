<p>The Advantages and Challenges of Using Factorial Designs One of the big advantages of factorial designs is that they allow researchers to look for interactions between independent variables. Factorial designs are more efficient than OFAT experiments. The relative efficiency of factorials continues to increase with every added factor. In this case a Plackett-Burman designs can gather the same information on eleven variables in just 12 tests. A design with 9 factors requires 512 runs.

By using a factorial design the business researcher can analyze both variables at the same time in one design saving the time and effort of doing two different analyses and minimizing the experiment-wise error rate. The factorial design as well as simplifying the process and making research cheaper allows many levels of analysis. A completely randomized design that you proposed runs the risk of an unbalanced design and confounding factors making it difficult to determine the effect of the individual factors.
