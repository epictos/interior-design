<p>Three names stand out as true pioneers in these early truss bridges. Through our experiment it was found that the bridge design that minimized the maximum compression force was the Howe Bridge. That commonly arises in modern design.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-the-baltimore-truss-different-from-the-pratt-truss">How is the Baltimore truss different from the Pratt truss.</h3><p>Built 1927 by the Dravo Contracting and American Bridge Company. Introduction Through our experiment it was found that the bridge design that minimized the maximum compression force was the Howe Bridge. The difference between Pratt truss and Baltimore truss is that the latter is strengthened by providing additional support in the lower section. In the Howe truss design the longer diagonal members are in compression while the shorter vertical members are in tension. The Baltimore truss is a sub-type of the Pratt truss but differs by the addition of half-length struts or ties in the top bottom or both parts of the panels. The Baltimore truss is a modified version of the Pratt truss.</p>
