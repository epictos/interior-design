<p>Because crossover trials have the advantage of reducing the number of subjects needed and the economic cost to be performed they have many advocates within the scientific community. You also get lots of interior space and usually pretty good crash protection.

<p>The particular strength of this design is that the interventions under investigation are evaluated within the same patients and so eliminates between-subject variability. The advantage of a parallel design is that it provides the best way to assess the effect of a drug on survival if that is the critical endpoint in its evaluation.

<p>The crossover design has numerous advantages that investigators may wish to use for early stage trials. The advantage of a parallel design is that it provides the best way to assess the effect of a drug on survival if that is the critical endpoint in its evaluation. This study design provides the advantage of reducing the variability in outcome measures from outside confounders because each patient will serve as his or her own control. Several advantages and disadvantages are worth considering when looking at cross-sectional studies.
