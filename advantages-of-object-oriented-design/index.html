<h3 id="encapsulation-part-1">Encapsulation part 1.</h3><p>OOP projects tend to be easier to design than implement. From enabling the implementation of a software based on the concepts of objects and deleting the shared data areas to distributing and executing the object sequentially or in parallel the benefits of this approach of software design. It reduce the development time. Thus it is orthogonal to function -oriented design. The first step is to design a class that represents a product category that your company sells. Object-oriented programming is modular as it provides separation of duties in object-based program development.</p>
