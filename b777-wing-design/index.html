Three additions were made to the tool to further improve the results or to make the application of the sizing process more convenient respectively. The design for the 777 9 which will be the launch variant was finalised on 03 September 2015. Both have in effect a raked wingtip that gives the pros the designers are looking for without the extra weightdrag etc of a winglet. Boeing 777 Specs 200LR and Boeing 777 300ER.
