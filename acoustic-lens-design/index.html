<p><strong>Acoustic Lens Design</strong>, Based on this lumped network an acoustic negative index lens is implemented by a two-dimensional 2D array of subwavelength Helmholtz resonators. For sur face imaging applications it is desired to have a small spot size and low sidelobe level. In this paper a newly designed composite acoustic lens that can achieve wave convergence is proposed by assembling a lattice array of concave hexagonal CH-shaped rods.</p>

<p>Design of acoustic lens The acoustic lens was initially designed based on the par-axial theory or Fresnel approximation in geometrical optics assuming a plane wave front emitted in a direction normal to the transducer surface 13 18 22 23. An experimental study of a lens designed to increase the dispersion at 4000 Hz of the far field of a seven inch driver is described and compared to the theoretical predictions. In this paper a newly designed composite acoustic lens that can achieve wave convergence is proposed by assembling a lattice array of concave hexagonal CH-shaped rods.</p>
<h3 id="researchers-from-the-university-of-sussex-used-3d-printing-for-a-modular-approach-to-acoustic-lens-design">Researchers from the University of Sussex used 3D printing for a modular approach to acoustic lens design.</h3><p>As such its design inputs were derived from our interactions with our project customer Dr. Based on this lumped network an acoustic negative index lens is implemented by a two-dimensional 2D array of subwavelength Helmholtz resonators. In a practical speaker installation the acoustic lens reduced the on-axis beaming effect by reshaping the drivers planar wave front into a spherical one. The Acoustic Lens Design project is a senior design driven imaging system. This allows for thinner lenses that can achieve the same focal distance with less impedance mismatch and fewer materials1012 Here a hyperbolic secant distribution is imposed because it produces lenses free of aberrations. Lens Design A lens design must consider beamwidth sidelobe amplitudes field of view and lens efficiency.</p>

<p>The accuracy of the approximation depends on the size of the lens system with respect to the wavelength of light or sound passing through it. 3D printing opens up the possibility of creating a range of such lenses for various purposes particularly changing the shape and nature of emitted wave fronts. So to make it work properly youd need some way of determining what the curve and size of the lens should be for your drivers.
