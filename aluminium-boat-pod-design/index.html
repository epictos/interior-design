<p>Ok guys doing some work on my haines and Im looking at putting a pod on my boat but i am a little lost as to what is best a glass pod or an aluminium pod for a glass boatWill it affect its performance or can it damage the transom from the lack of flex from the aluminium pod. Aluminum Designs for CNC. Sep 17 2017 - Explore Daryl Christensens board boat pods on Pinterest. Cheers I took the following from the internet - Boat bottoms have the least drag at an angle of from 3 to 5 degreeswith the waterIf they run flatter than 3 degrees as most light planing boats tend to do or steeper than 5 degrees as stern-heavy boats just barely on plane may do efficiency suffers. Our pods are professionally engineered by specialists in aluminum boat design. Jon Boat Float Pods Jon Boat Folding Boat Duck Hunting Boat.</p>
