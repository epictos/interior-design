Top-down model has high ratio of redundancy as the size of project increases. Difference between Bottom-Up Model and Top-Down Model. In bottom-up approach the individual parts are designed to fulfil the intended function and then put together. I expect you mean top-down design vs bottom-up design - normalization being just one aspect of the methods and principles you would use to complete a database design. Well if you were to gauge the current zeitgeist in business and popular culture youd get a strong sense that the bottom-up camp is right camp to be in.</p>

<p>A top-down design project starts with the broad project specification in mind and putting that information in a centralized location. In some cases top-down design can lead to unsatisfactory results because the analyst and end-users can miss something that is important and is necessary for the system. Top-down means you start with a set of requirements. Key Differences Between Top-down and Bottom-up Approach.
