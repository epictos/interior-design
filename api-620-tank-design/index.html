<p>The API 620 tank standard regulates the design and construction of large chemical and oil storage tanks at least 300 feet in diameter that can house contents up to 15 PSI such as liquefied natural gas LNG cryogenic liquids and other low-temperature -325 to 250 degrees F higher-pressure liquids gases and vapors. API 650 Appendix V provides the normal operating external pressure range as 025 kPa 0036 lbfin2 to 69 kPa 10 lbfin2. Demonstrate the requirements timing and frequency of storage tank inspection. Normally API 620 tanks have more design pressure as compared to API 650 tanks. API publications necessarily address problems of a general nature. Api 620 Tanks Pdf.</p>
